# Weather-Channel

The Weather Channel allows users to search cities and retrieve the current temperatures. It saves their most recent search and will show it when they refresh the page. It dynamically changes based on the current UV index of the city searched.

# Features

This page calls 2 API's. The second API is called based on the latitude and longitude of the first. It stores data in local storage and retrieves the most recent search when the Customer returns to the page. The UV index background-color dynamically changes based on the current index of the city searched.
